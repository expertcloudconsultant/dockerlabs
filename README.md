# dockerlabs

The provided code appears to be a Python script for managing Docker containers and MongoDB entries for user accounts. It listens for changes in a MongoDB collection and, when a new user entry is added, it creates a Docker container for that user.

Here's an overview of what this script does:

1. It imports various Python modules, including `os`, `time`, `random`, `string`, `pymongo`, `docker`, `subprocess`, and `shlex`.

2. It establishes a connection to a MongoDB database using the PyMongo library.

3. It establishes a connection to the Docker daemon using the Docker library.

4. There are functions for creating a user, writing user data to MongoDB, generating a random password, creating a Docker container for a user, and managing Docker networks and images.

5. The `remove_unused_networks` function checks for and removes Docker networks that are not attached to any containers. If networks are still attached to containers, it disconnects the containers before removing the network.

6. The `create_network` function creates a Docker network if it doesn't already exist.

7. The `build_docker_image` function generates a Dockerfile, builds a Docker image based on that file, and then removes the Dockerfile.

8. The `get_random_port` function generates a random port number within a specific range.

9. The `update_dashboard` function is a placeholder for updating a dashboard with user details. It currently prints the username and SSH access pin.

10. In the main block, the script enters an infinite loop to monitor the MongoDB collection for changes. When a new user entry is added, it calls the `create_docker_container` function to create a Docker container for that user.

Please note that this script is intended to run continuously, monitoring the MongoDB collection for changes. When a new user entry is detected, it creates a Docker container for that user and updates the dashboard (though the actual implementation of dashboard updating is missing in the code). The script also takes care of managing Docker networks and images.

Make sure you have the necessary Python libraries (`pymongo` and `docker`) installed and that your Docker daemon is running for this script to work correctly. Additionally, you'll need to set up the MongoDB database and provide the appropriate MongoDB connection settings.
